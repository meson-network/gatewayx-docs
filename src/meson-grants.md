## FAQ
#### Can I directly apply for 2nd/3rd tier?
Begin with the 1st Tier; once your contributions have been acknowledged and rewarded for this level, you may then proceed to submit for the 2nd Tier, then 3rd Tier.

#### Is it possible to apply for the same tier multiple times?
You are welcome to apply at your convenience. However, please note that the 1st Tier offers a one-time reward for your community contributions, whereas the 2nd Tier provides ongoing rewards, contingent on meeting the set criteria.

#### Where can I find the description for stages
